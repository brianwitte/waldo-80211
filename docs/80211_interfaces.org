     interference to understand channel utilization.
   - **nl80211 Commands**: `NL80211_CMD_SET_CHANNEL`, `NL80211_CMD_GET_SURVEY`

*** latency metrics:
   - **feature**: measure and display the round-trip time (rtt) and other
     latency-related statistics for the wireless link.
   - **nl80211 Commands**: This may require custom commands or piggybacking on
     other commands that measure RTT, such as `NL80211_CMD_GET_STATION` for
     round-trip information.

*** connection stability diagnostics:
   - **feature**: diagnose connection stability issues by tracking
     disconnections, beacon loss, and other anomalies.
   - **nl80211 Commands**: `NL80211_CMD_GET_STATION`,
     `NL80211_CMD_SET_PROBE_RESP`, `NL80211_CMD_REGISTER_BEACONS`

*** roaming behavior and decision analysis:
   - **feature**: analyze the decision-making process of roaming, including when
     and why the driver decides to roam.
   - **nl80211 Commands**: `NL80211_CMD_GET_ROAM_SUPPORT`,
     `NL80211_CMD_SET_ROAM_SUPPORT`

** cfg80211 tracepoints

    *cfg80211_scan_done*: provides information when a scan operation is
    completed. useful for understanding scan behaviors and troubleshooting scan
    related issues.

    *cfg80211_sched_scan_results*: offers details on the results of a scheduled
    scan, which is crucial for understanding the environment the wireless device
    is operating in.

    *cfg80211_reg_can_beacon*: traces regulatory beaconing information. this can
    be critical for understanding regulatory compliance and constraints.

    *cfg80211_ready_on_channel*: indicates when a device is ready on a specific
    channel, which is important for channel-based operations and
    troubleshooting.

    *cfg80211_connect_result*: this tracepoint can provide information about the
    result of a connection attempt, which is vital for debugging connection
    issues.

    *cfg80211_rx_mgmt*: traces the reception of management frames. this is useful
    for understanding management operations at a lower level.

    *cfg80211_radar_event*: radar events are crucial for dfs (dynamic frequency
    selection). tracing these can help understand channel switches due to radar
    detections.

    *cfg80211_disconnected*: provides details when a disconnection event occurs,
    helping to debug disconnection or connectivity stability issues.

    *cfg80211_new_sta*: traces when a new station joins. this is helpful for
    understanding association and roaming behavior in managed networks.

    *cfg80211_cqm_rssi_notify*: traces rssi (received signal strength indicator)
    notifications, which are crucial for performance and quality-of-service
    analysis.
